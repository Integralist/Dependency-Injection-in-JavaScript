        <title>Dependency Injection with JavaScript</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This page demonstrates how Dependency Injection is used to load a different welcome message (there are two messages that could be loaded).</p>
        <p>The example code is silly in that it randomly decides which welcome message to show (so it should change between page refreshes)</p>
        <p>Check the <code>console.log</code>'s to see the welcome message (you might have to refresh a couple of times to see the different welcome message)</p>
        <script src="scripts/loader.js" data-main="app"></script> <!-- you might load different 'apps' on different pages -->
